                <p><img src="Welcome.jpg" " alt=" Welcome" class="floatleft">



                <p>Step into the peaceful retreat where Albert Einstein spent his summers thinking big thoughts, sailing small boats, and
                proving that bad hair is timeless. Here, relativity meets relaxation — the lake sparkles, ideas float, and time feels
                deliciously bendy.
                You can sit where genius once sat, stare at the same sky that inspired E = mc², and maybe even come up with your own
                theory (like why your phone battery dies faster near beautiful scenery)..

                    " alt="Einstein working"
                        class="floatleft">Tucked behind the famous summerhouse lies Einstein’s Garden — a quiet patch of green where the world’s most famous
                        thinker found calm among cabbages, cosmos, and cosmic thoughts.
                        
                        Einstein believed that nature was the best
                        teacher — and that a walk among plants could solve almost any problem (except maybe quantum mechanics).
                        
                        The garden isn’t huge, but its roots run deep: this is where simplicity met genius, where time slowed down, and where
                        relativity took a breather.
